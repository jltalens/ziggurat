Trend analysis tool for git repositories

## Motivation

It started by watching this [talk](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/61483799) by Michael Feathers about trend analysis and digging a little bit about [Empirical Software Engineering](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ese/) 
I've decided to create a tool that will basically mimic the one Feathers [created](https://github.com/michaelfeathers/delta-flora) but instead of Ruby I'll target Javascript, why? because it's one of the languages I'm most confortable with.
Ironically I'll use Scala to build this tool as I've been involved in a Scala project at my current workplace and I like to give it go.


## Usage

TBD
